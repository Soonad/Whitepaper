# Moonad: a Peer-to-Peer Operating System

Victor Maia, John Burnham

**Abstract.**

We present **Moonad**, a peer-to-peer operating system. Its machine language,
**FM-Net**, consists of a massively parallel, beta-optimal graph-reduction
system based on interaction nets. Moonad's purely functional user-facing
language, **Formality** features a powerful, elegant type-system capable of
stating and proving theorems about its own programs through inductive
Î»-encodings. Online interactions are made through **Trellis**, a global
append-only event-log compatible with both trusted and decentralizd backends.
On top of those, we build a front-end interface, **Moonad**, where users can
create, deploy and use decentralized applications (Forall), pose and solve
mathematical problems (Provit), and exchange scarce virtual assets (Phos).

## Introduction

Computing is a field in its infancy. While humans have performed manual
computation with fingers, pencil, abacus or quipu since time immemorial, it has
been only 75 years since the first *general-purpose* computing machine was
switched on. Given how ubiquitous computers are in our lives today, it can be
easy to forget this, but there are hundreds of millions still living who are
older than the computer. If a generation in human terms is 25 years, computers
users today are at most third-generation.

Accordingly, it should not be surprising that computing systems we use in
practice -devices, operating systems, programming languages- lag behind
(sometimes *far* behind) theoretical or experimental systems. Consider that the
most popular operating system in the world, Android was designed in the late
2000s, based on a kernel from the 1990s (Linux), which itself was based on a
design from the 1970s. There simply hasn't been enough time for all the good
ideas to be discovered and to percolate into common use.

For example, most electronic authentication on the web is still done with
passwords (sometimes stored in plain-text!), despite the fact that this
contributes to tens of billions of dollars lost per year to [identity
theft][id-theft] and that secure systems for [authentication based on public key
cryptography][pgp] have existed for at least the past 30 years.

In a related area, most electronic commerce is mediated by centralized trusted
counterparties, despite the fact that this regularly leads to [data
breaches][data-breach] that compromise the security of millions of people.
Decentralized systems, such [cryptographic ledgers using
byzantine-fault-tolerant chains of signed transactions][bitcoin] and [trustless
distributed computing platforms][ethereum] have been under intense development
for the better part of the past decade, but have yet to gain widespread
adoption.

There has been tremendous theoretical progress in programming language and
compiler design, that is barely exploited. We have substructural type systems
that can eliminate resource management errors (like segmentation faults) and
ensure memory safety.  We have proof languages capable of unifying the field of
mathematics and programming as one (the Curry-Howard correspondence). In
principle, we could have systems software that is formally proven to be
error-free, and proof assistants that are both user-friendly enough to be
taught in grade-school math class and performant enough to be used on any
platform.

Contrast this theoretical progress with our practical record: not long ago, we
had a single, small malicious package cause the entire web ecosystem [to
collapse][left-pad], [twice][event-stream]. More than [300,000
sites](https://wpvulndb.com/statistics) online today are vulnerable to SQL
injections. Bugs like [heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) and [TheDAO][DAO]
cause enormous monetary losses. A single [CPU exploit][meltdown-spectre] slowed
down nearly every processor in the world by 30%. Faulty software kills people,
routinely causing [airplanes to crash][737-max] and hospitals to [stop
operating][ohio-hospital].

We believe this mismatch between theory and practice is due to presentation:
The technology exists, we need to build the user experience.

Moonad aims to assemble many of these amazing technologies into a decentralized
operating system that "just works". We aim to use type theory to build computing
systems that are safer, faster and friendlier.

## Formality: An efficient functional programming and proof language

The Curry-Howard correspondence states that there is a structural congruence
between computer programs and proofs in formal logic.  While in theory this
implies that software developers and mathematicians are engaged in substantially
the same activity, in practice there are many barriers preventing the
unification of the two fields. Programming languages with type systems
expressive enough to take advantage of Curry-Howard, such as Haskell, Agda and
Coq generally have substantial runtime overhead, which makes them challenging to
use, particularly at the systems programming level. On the other hand, systems
languages such as Rust, Nim or ATS, have shown that type systems can greatly
enhance usability and correctness of low-level software, but either have type
systems too weak to fully exploit Curry-Howard (Rust, Nim), or introduce
syntactic complexity that limits adoption (ATS). In other words, there are lots
of slow languages with great type systems and lots of fast languages with lousy
type systems.

As programmers and as mathematicians, we don't want to compromise.
On one side, mathematicians have the power of rigor: there is nothing more
undeniably correct than a mathematical proof. Yet ironically, those proofs are
often written, checked and reviewed by humans in an extremelly error-prone
process. On the other side, programmers have the power of automation: there is
nothing more capable of performing a huge set of tasks without making a single
mistake than a computer program. Yet, equally ironically, most of those programs
are written in an unrigorous, bug-ridden fashion. Formality lies in the
intersection between both fields: it is a programming language in which
developers are capable of implementing everyday algorithms and data structures,
but it is also a proof language, on which mathematicians are capable of
proposing and proving theorems.

Formality's types can be seen as a language of specfications that can be
mechanically checked by the compiler, allowing you to enforce arbitrary
guarantees on your program's behavior. For example, in an untyped language, you
could write an algorithm such as:

```javascript
// Returns the element at index `idx` of an array `arr`
function get_at(i, arr) {
  ... code here ...
}
```

But this has no guarantees. You could call it with nonsensical arguments such
as `get_at("foo", 42)`, and the compiler would do nothing to stop you, leading
to (possibly catastrophical) runtime errors. Traditional typed languages
improve the situation, allowing you to "enrich" that definition with simple or
even polymorphic types, such as:

```javascript
function get_at<A>(i : Num, arr : Array<A>) : A {
  ... code here ...
}
```

This has some guarantees. For example, it is impossible to call `get_at` with a
String index, preventing a wide class of runtime errors. But you can still, for
example, call `get_at` with an index out of bounds. In fact, a similar error
caused the catastrophic [heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) vulnerability.
Formality types are arbitrarily expressive, allowing you to capture all demands
you'd expect from `get_at`:

```javascript
get_at*L : {A: Type, i: Fin(L), arr: Vector(A, L)} -> [x: A ~ At(A,L,i,arr,x)]
  ... code here ...
```

Here, we use a bound, `L`, to enforce that the index is not larger than the
size of the array, and we also demand that the returned element, `x: A`, is
exactly the one at index `i`. This specification is complete, in the
mathematical sense. It is not only impossible to get a runtime error by calling
`get_at`, but it is also impossible to write `get_at` incorrectly to begin
with. Note that this is different from, for example, `assert`s or bound
checking. Here, the compiler statically reasons about the flow or your program,
assuring that it can't go wrong with zero runtime costs.

In a similar fashion, you could use types to ensure that the balance of a
smart-contract never violates certain invariants, or that an airplane
controller won't push its nose down to a crashing position. Of course, you
don't *need* to write types so precise. If your software doesn't demand
security, you could go all way down to having fully untyped programs. The point
is that the ability of expressing properties so precisely is immensely
valuable, specially when developing critical software that demands all the
security one can afford.

---

Some readers might object here that while formal proofs can ensure that a
program's implementation matches its specification, it cannot eliminate errors
inherent to the specification. This is true, but, in many cases, specifications
are much smaller than implementations. For example, 

```javascript
spec : Type
  [
    // Demands a List function such that
    sort : List(Word) -> List(Word),

    // It returns the same list in ascendinig order
    And(is_same(xs, sort(ys)), is_ascending(sort(ys)))
  ]
```

The `spec` above demands a `List` function such that it returns the same list
in ascending order. Writing and auditing this specification is considerably
easier than implementing a complete `sort` function. As such, formal
verification can be seen as an optimization of human auditing: instead of
verifying a vast amount of code, you audit a small specification and let the
compiler do the rest.

---

### An accessible syntax

Proof languages often have complex syntaxes that make them needlessly
inaccessible, as if the subject wasn't hard enough already. Coq, for example,
uses 3 different languages with different rules and an overall heavy syntax.
Agda is clean and beautiful, but relies heavily on unicode and agda-mode, making
it essentially unusable outside of EMACs, which is arguably a "hardcore" editor.
Formality aims to keep a simple, familiar syntax that is much closer to common
languages like Python and JavaScript. 

```javascript
// A natural number is either `zero` or the successor of a natural number
T Nat
| succ {pred : Nat}
| zero

// A vector is a list with a statically known length
T Vector {A : Type} (len : Nat)
| vcons {len : Nat, head : A, tail : Vector(A, len)} (succ(len))
| vnil                                               (zero)

// A type-safe "head" that returns the first element of a non-empty vector
// - On the `vcons` case, return the vector's head
// - On the `vnil` case, prove it is unreachable, since `xs.len > 0`
vhead : {~T : Type, ~n : Nat, xs : Vector(T, succ(n))} -> T
  case/Vector xs
  note e : xs.len is succ(n)
  | vcons => xs.head
  | vnil  => absurd(zero_isnt_succ(~n, ~e), ~T) 
  : T
```

Our goal is for a regular TypeScript developer to be able to read e.g. our
[Functor](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Control.Functor.fm)
formalization without too much effort:

```javascript
T Functor {F : Type -> Type}
| functor 

  // A mapping function
  { map : {~A : Type , ~B : Type , f : A -> B, x : F(A)} -> F(B)

  // Satisfying the identity law
  , identity : {~A : Type , fa : F(A)} -> map(~A, ~A, id(~A),fa) == fa

  // Satisfying the composition law
  , composition :
      { ~A : Type, ~B : Type, ~C : Type, g : B -> C, f : A -> B, fa : F(A)
      } -> map(~A, ~C, {x} g(f(x)), fa) == map(~B, ~C, g, map(~A, ~B, f, fa))

  }
```

While we may not be quite there, we're making fast progress towards that goal.

### Fast and portable "by design"

Some languages are inherently slow, by design. JavaScript, for example, is
slower than C: all things equal, its mandatory garbage collector will be an
unavoidable disadvantage. Even C, arguably the fastest modern language, has its
flaws, as its ultra-sequential model of computation has hit a hard barrier.
Formality is meant to be as fast as theoretically possible. For example, it has
affine lambdas, allowing it to be garbage-collection-free. It has a strongly
confluent interaction-net runtime, allowing it to be evaluated in massively
parallel architectures. It is a functional language that doesnât require bruijn
bookkeeping, making it the fastest âclosure chunkerâ around. It is lazy, has a
clear cost model for blockchains and a minuscle (448 LOC) runtime, making it
extremelly portable.

If we designed our operating system using a language like C, it'd be fast
today, but, on the long-term, it would become obsolete. Instead, we decided to
rely on a new model of computation that isn't as fast today, since it is
competing against decades of optimizations, but that has the best computational
characteristics imaginable, making it extremely future-proof and giving it a
virtually unbounded room for improvements. In other words, Formality is fast
"by design".

### An optimal high-order evaluator

Formality's substitution algorithm is **asymptotically faster** than Haskell's,
Clojure's, JavaScript's and other closure implementations. This makes it
extremely fast at evaluating high-order programs, combining a Haskell-like
high-level feel with a Rust-like low-level performance curve. For example,
Haskell's stream fusion, a hard-coded, important optimization, happens
naturally, [at
runtime](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/solving-the-mystery-behind-abstract-algorithms-magical-optimizations-144225164b07),
on Formality. This also allow us to explore new ways to develop algorithms, such
as this "impossibly efficient" [exp-mod
implementation](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/calling-a-function-a-googol-times-53933c072e3a)
implementation. Who knows if this may lead to new breakthroughs in complexity
theory?

### Guaranteed termination

All programs written in Formality are guaranteed to halt, and enjoy key
computational characteristics that differ from classic functional languages.
This directly enables many runtime features and optimizations (such as no
book-keeping), although without loss of generality as Formality can model
Turing-Complete programs via corecursion. In other words, Turing-Complete
computation can be performed by writing an iteration step function in Formality
and either looping this function infinitely in your runtime system, or folding
this function over a Church number representing a finite bound on
the computation.

We view this design decision as a principled acknowledgement that in
practice no real software is truly Turing-Complete; actual physical systems can
only be finite state machines.

### An elegant underlying Type Theory

Formality's unique approach to termination is conjectured to allow it to have
elegant, powerful type-level features that would be otherwise impossible without
causing logical inconsistencies. For example, instead of built-in datatypes, we
rely on [Self
Types](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Self-Types-for-Dependently-Typed-Lambda-Encodings-Fu-Stump/652f673e13b889e0fd7adbd480c2fdf290621f66),
which allow us to implement inductive families with native lambdas. As history
tells, having elegant foundations often pays back. We've not only managed to
port several proofs from other assistants, but found techniques to [emulate
Coq's structural
recursion](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/commit/b777d806c6fa37f2ce306fbe87b3ed267152b90c),
to perform large eliminations, and even an hypothetical encoding of [higher
inductive
types](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Example.HigherInductiveType.fm);
and we've barely began exploring the system.

## FM-Net: a massively parallel, low-level machine language

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/inet-simulation.gif)

*Interaction Net (inet) simulation*

Formality terms are compiled to a memory-efficient interaction net system called
FM-Net. Interaction nets are graphs where nodes have labeled ports, one
being the main one, plus a list of "rewrite rules" that are activated whenever
two nodes are connected by their main ports. A simple interaction-net
graph-rewrite system called "interaction combinators" with only 3 symbols and 6
rules was shown to be a universal model of [computation][2]. As a universal mode,
interaction-nets combine many useful properties of other models such as Turing
machines and the lambda calculus. Like Turing machines, interactions-nets can be
evaluated as a series of atomic, local operations with a clear physical
implementation. Like the lambda calculus, interaction-nets are inherently
parallel, but in a more robust manner, admitting desirable computational
properties such as strong confluence, optimal sharing and zero-cost
garbage-collection.

We use a slightly modified version of interaction combinators, called FM-Net as
our lowest-level machine language, extending interaction combinators with
additional graph node types for efficient numeric operations. Our
implementation has advantages over previous interaction net graph-reduction
systems (such as the Bologna Optimal Higher-order Machine) in that it requires
no book-keeping, requires only 128 bits per lambda or pair, has unboxed 32-bit
integers and constant-time beta reduction. This is possible due to Formality's
stratification, a structural discipline on how terms are duplicated, inherited
from its underlying logic, Elementary Affine.


### Node Types

Our FM-Net system includes 6 types of nodes, ERA, CON, OP1, OP2, ITE, NUM.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/fm-net-node-types.png)

- `CON` has 3 ports and an integer label. It is used to represent lambdas,
  applications, boxes (implicitly) and duplications. Just `CON` is enough for
  beta-reduction.

- `ERA` has 1 port and is used to free empty memory, which happens when a
  function that doesn't use its bound variable is applied to an argument.

- `NUM` has 1 port and stores an integer and is used to represent native
  numbers.

- `OP1` has 2 ports and stores one integer and an operation id. `OP2` has 3
  ports and an operation id. They are used for numeric operations such as
  addition and multiplication.

- `ITE` has 3 ports and an integer label. It is used for if-then-else, and is
  required to enable number-based branching.

Note that the position of the port matters. The port on top is called the `main`
port. The first port counter-clockwise to the main port (i.e., to the left on
this drawing) is the `aux0` port, and the first port clockwise to the main port
(i.e., to the right on this drawing) is the `aux1` port.

### Rewrite rules

In order to perform computations, FM-Net has a set of rewrite rules that are
triggered whenever two nodes are connected by their main ports. This is an
extensive list of those rules:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/fm-net-rewrite-rules.png)

Note that, while there are many rules (since we need to know what to do on each
combination of a node), most of those have the same "shape" (such as OP2-OP2,
ITE-ITE), so they can reuse the same code. There are only 5 actually relevant
rules:

- **Erasure**: When an `ERA` or a `NUM` node collides with anything, it
  "destroys" the other node, and propagates itself to destroy all nodes
  connected to it.

- **Substitution**: When two `CON` nodes of equal label collide, and also on the
  `OP2-OP2` / `ITE-ITE` cases, both nodes are destroyed, and their neighbors are
  connected.  That's the rule that performs beta-reduction because it allows
  connecting the body of a lambda (which is represented with `CON`) to the
  argument of an application (which is, too, represented with `CON`). Note that
  on the OP2-OP2 and ITE-ITE cases, that's just a default rule that doesn't
  matter, since those cases can't happen on valid Formality programs.

- **Duplication**: When different nodes collide, they "pass through" each other,
  duplicating themselves in the process. This allows, for example, `CON` nodes
  with a label `>1` to be used to perform deep copies of any term, with `dup x =
  val; ...`.  It can copy lambdas and applications because they are represented
  with `CON` nodes with a label `0`, pairs and pair-accessors, because they are
  represented with `CON` nodes with a label `1`, and `ITE`, `OP1`, `OP2`,
  because they are different nodes.

  It also allows duplications to duplicate terms that are partially duplicated
  (i.e., which must duplicate, say, a Î»-bound variable), as long as the `CON`
  labels are different, otherwise, the `CON` nodes would instead fall in the
  substitution case, destroying each other and connecting neighbors, which isn't
  correct. That's why FMC's box system is necessary: to prevent concurrent
  duplication processes to interfere with each other by ensuring that, whenever
  you duplicate a term with `dup x = val; ...`, all the duplication `CON` nodes
  of `val` will have a labels higher than the one used by that `dup`.

- **If-Then-Else** When an `ITE` node collides with a `NUM` node, it becomes a
  `CON` node with one of its ports connected to an `ERA` node. That's because
  then/else branches are actually stored in a pair, and this allows you to
  select either the `fst` or the `snd` value of that pair and discard the other
  branch.

- **Num-Operation** When `OP2` collides with a `NUM`, it becomes an `OP1` node
  and stores the number inside it; i.e., the binary operation becomes a unary
  operation with `NUM` partially applied. When that `OP1` collides with another
  `NUM`, then it performs the binary operation on both operands, and return a
  new `NUM` with the result.  Those rules allow us to add, multiply, divide and
  so on native numbers.

### Compiling Formality terms to FM-Net

The process of compiling Formality terms to FM-Net can be defined by the following
function `k_b(net)`:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/fm-net-compilation.png)

This function recursively walks through a term, creating nodes and "temporary
variables" (`x_b`) in the process. It also keeps track of the number of boxes it
passed through, `b`. For example, on the lambda (`{x}f`) case, the procedure
creates a `CON` node with a label `0`, creates a "temporary variable" `x_b` on
the `aux0` port, recurses towards the body of the function, `f` on the `aux1`
port, and then returns the `main` port (because there is a black ball on it).
Notice that there isn't a case for `VAR`. That's what those "temporary
variables" are for. On the `VAR` case, two things can happen:

1. If the corresponding "temporary variable" `x_b` was never used, simply return
   a pointer to it.

2. If the corresponding "temporary variable" `x_b` was used, create a "CON" node
   with a label `2 + b`, connect its main port to the old location of `x_b`, its
   `aux0` to the port `x_b` pointed to, and return a pointer to its `aux1` port.

This process allows us to create as many `CON` nodes as needed to duplicate
`dup`-bound variables, and labels those nodes with the layer of that `dup` (plus
2, since labels 0 and 1 are used for lambdas/applications and
pairs/projections). Note that this process is capable of duplicating Î»-bound
variables, but this isn't safe in practice, and won't happen in well-typed
inputs.

### Implementation

In our implementation, we use a buffer of 32-bit unsigned integers to represent
nodes, as follows:

- `CON`: represented by 4 consecutive uints. The first 3 represent the `main`,
  `aux0` and `aux1` ports. The last one represents the node type (2 bits),
  whether its ports are pointers or unboxed numbers (3 bits), and the label (27
  bits).

- `OP1`: represented by 4 consecutive uints. The first 2 represent the `main`
  and `aux0` ports. The third represents the stored number. The last one
  represents the node type (2 bits), whether its ports are pointers or unboxed
  numbers (3 bits, 1 unused), and the operation (27 bits).

- `OP2`: represented by 4 consecutive uints. The first 2 represent the `main`,
  `aux0` and `aux1` ports. The third represents the stored number. The last one
  represents the node type (2 bits), whether its ports are pointers or unboxed
  numbers (3 bits), and the operation (27 bits).

- `ITE`: represented by 4 consecutive uints. The first 2 represent the `main`,
  `aux0` and `aux1` ports. The third represents the stored number. The last one
  represents the node type (2 bits), whether its ports are pointers or unboxed
  numbers (3 bits), and the label (27 bits).

- `ERA`: is stored inside other nodes and do not use any extra space. An `ERA`
  node is represented by a pointer port which points to itself. That's because
  `ERA`'s rewrite rules coincide with what we'd get if we allowed ports to point
  to themselves.

- `NUM`: is stored inside other nodes and do not use any extra space. A `NUM`
  node is represented by a numeric port. In order to know if a port is a number
  or a pointer, each node reserves 3 bits of its last uint to store that
  information.

#### Rewrites

TODO: explain how `rewrite` works, how `link_ports` is used, and why
`unlink_ports` is necessary to avoid invalid states.

#### Strict evaluation

The strict evaluation algorithm is very simple. First, we must keep a set of
redexes, i.e., nodes connected by their main ports. In order to do that,
whenever we link two main ports, we must add the address of the smallest nodes
to that set. We then perform a loop to rewrite all redexes. This will give us a
new set of redexes, which must then be reduced again, over and over, until there
are no redexes left. This is the pseudocode:

```python
while (len(net.redexes) > 0):
  for redex in net.redexes:
    net.rewrite(redex)
```

The strict reduction is interesting because it doesn't require graph walking nor
garbage collection passes, and because the inner `for`-loop can be performed in
parallel. That is, every `redex` in `net.redexes` can be rewritten at the same
time.

In order to do that, though, one must be cautious with intersection areas. For
example, in the graph below, B-C and D-E are redexes. If we reduce them in
parallel, both threads will attempt to read/write from C's and D's `aux0` and
`aux1` ports, potentially causing synchronization errors.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/Absal/sk_problem_2x.png)

This can be avoided through locks, or by performing rewrites in two steps. On
the first step, each thread reads/writes the ports of its own active pair as
usual, except that, when it would need to connect a neighbor, it instead turns
its own node into a "redirector" which points to where the neighbor was supposed
to point. For example, substitution and duplication would be performed as
follows:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/Absal/sk_local_rewrites_2x.png)

Notice that `P`, `Q`, `R` and `S` (neighbor ports) weren't touched: they keep
pointing to the same ports, but now those ports point to where they should point
to. Then, a second parallel step is performed. This time, we spawn a thread for
each neighbor port and walk through the graph until we find a non-redirector
node. We then point that neighbor to it. Here is a full example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/Absal/sk_local_rewrites_ex_2x.png)

Notice, for example, the port `C` of the node `A`. It is on the neighborhoods of
a redex (`B-C`), but isn't a redex itself. On the first step, two threads
rewrite the nodes `B-C` and `D-E`, turning them into redirectors, and without
touching that port. On the second step, a thread starts from port `C` of node
`A`, towards port `B` of node `B` (a redirector), towards port `C` of node `D`
(a redirector), towards port `B` of node ` F`. Since that isn't a redirector,
the thread will make `C` point to `B`. The same is done for each neighbor port
(in parallel), completing the parallel reduction.

#### Lazy evaluation

The lazy evaluation algorithm is very different from the strict one. It works by
traversing the graph, exploring it to find redexes that are "visible" on the
normal form of the term, skipping unnecessary branches. It is interesting
because it allows avoiding wasting work; for example, `({a b}b)(f(42), 7)` would
quickly evaluate to `7`, no matter how long `f(42)` takes to compute. In
exchange, it is "less parallel" than the strict algorithm (we can't reduce all
redexes since we don't know if they're necessary), and it requires global
garbage collection (since erasure nodes are ignored).

To skip unnecessary branches, we must walk through the graph from  port to port,
using a strategy very similar to the denotational semantics of symmetric
interaction combinators. First, we start walking from the root port to its
target port. Then, until we get back to the root, do as follows:

1. If we're walking from an aux port towards an aux port of a node, add the aux
   we're coming from to a stack, and move towards the main port of that node.

2. If we're walking from a main port to an auxiliary port, then we just found a
   node that is part of the normal form of the graph! If we're performing a
   weak-head normal form reduction, stop. Otherwise, start walking towards each
   auxiliary port (either recursively, or in parallel).

3. If we're walking towards root, halt.

This is a rough pseudocode:

```python
def reduce_lazy(net, start):
  back = []
  prev = start
  next = net.enter(prev)

  while not(net.is_root(next)):
    if slot_of(prev) == 0 and slot_of(next) == 0:
      net.rewrite(prev, next)
    elif slot_of(next) == 0:
      for aux_n from 0 til net.aux_ports_of(next):
        net.reduce_lazy(Pointer(node_of(next), aux_n))
    else:
      back.push(prev)
      prev = Pointer(node_of(next), 0)
      next = net.enter(prev)
```

While the lazy algorithm is inherently sequential, there is still an opportunity
to explore parallelism whenever we find a node that is part of the normal form
of the graph (i.e., case `2`). In that case, we can spawn a thread to walk
towards each auxiliary port in parallel; i.e., the `for`-loop of the pseudocode
can be executed in parallel like the one on the strict version. This would allow
the algorithm to have many threads walking through the graph at the same time.
Again, caution must be taken to avoid conflicts.

## Trellis: a public event-log

Trellis is an append-only event-log divided into distinct labeled streams.

- Trellis is backend agnostic and can have streams which run on a centralized
  server, a decentralized blockchain or any variation or permutation thereof.

- `Map(Word256, List(Word1024))`

**TODO**

## Forall: a global repository of knowledge

TODO: types are theorems, programs are proofs, files are papers, imports are
citations. Forall is a both a package manager and a substitute for academic
publishing, where code can be used in mathematical publications, and proofs can
be used in code.

## Phos: a smart-contract platform

Phos is a Formality state-transition function, `phos : Event -> PhosState ->
PhosState`, that interprets Trellis event stream as a cryptographic ledger and
smart-contract platform.

## Moonad

Moonad is an user-facing application that combines all the systems above in an
unified package that just works. We call it an operating system in the sense
it is capable of scheduling and running applications, but it isn't one in the
traditional sense; as in, you won't be able to boot from it. It can be seen as
a sandboxed application platform.

Moonad uses FM-Net as its low-level machine language, Formality as its
user-facing language, Forall as its package-manager and Trellis as an
abstraction of the internet and online interactions and Phos as a
smart-contract platform. By combining those with a standard type for
applications, `App`, Moonad is capable of renderizing interactive online
applications that users send to Forall. Like many operating systems, it comes
with a set of built-in, essential applications, including:

## PhosWallet

Sending and receiving Phos Coins.

## AppStore

Finding and publishing cool applications.

## TrellisExplorer

Browsing the global event-log.

# Provit

Placing code/proof bounties on types.

# Forall

Uploading and downloading files to the package manager.

# Formality-IDE

Editor, evaluator, debugger and type-checker for Formality, including
interaction net visualization.

**TODO**
